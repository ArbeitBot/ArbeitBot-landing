First free open-source Telegram freelance market. Built by people for people.

#[Arbeitbot.com](https://arbeitbot.com) landing page
Welcome to the code repository of the [@arbeit_bot](https://telegram.me/arbeit_bot)'s landing page! In case you aren't interested in web frontend code or don't know what ArbeitBot is, please check out [bot's website](https://arbeitbot.com) or [bot's source code](https://github.com/ArbeitBot/ArbeitBot). Otherwise, if you have landed on the right page, please keep reading.

ArbeitBot is meant to be fully open-sourced, hence we even open-sourced less significant piece of code — landing page describing main features of the bot and displaying some relevant statistics like number of users, opened jobs and available freelancers.

The whole website has been designed by [@MixailE](https://github.com/MixailE), built by [@gdeleha](https://github.com/gdeleha) and maintained by the community. Website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), SLL is provided by [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com).

`gh-pages` is the main branch here which is displayed directly to [arbeitbot.com](https://arbeitbot.com). If we get lucky and finally get a hold on [@gdeleha](https://github.com/gdeleha) he may submit sources to `source` branch, which would be wonderful, am I right?

However, please don't put too much effort into existing website version as it will change eventually due to being outdated. The next webpage design will contain more useful information including project development roadmap. Stay tuned!
