# Top block
> Same title `ArbeitBot`, same slogan `First free open-source Telegram freelance market. Built by people for people` and button `Add to Telegram`

# Statistics
> Design should be modular — maybe we will add more stats later, but for now we should display these stats:

* Number of users registered
* Number of jobs closed
* Number of ratings received

# Features
> Here we should explain features of our bot, including being cross-platform. Current ones are listed below

* No more spam: You decide who receives your job offer
* No more waiting: Get the list of relevant and available freelancers as soon as you create a job
* Transparent: Don’t know how much to pay for your job? No worries – we display the number of available freelancers per each price range
* No communication limits: Need to discuss something tête-à-tête? Message the freelancer directly – it's a messenger, right?
* No more hustling: Got tired of constantly refreshing the page with job offers? Fill in your profile and wait for relevant job offers to hit your inbox
* No more fees: We are a completely non-profit organization and we aim to provide users with the best service possible, not making dimes of your neck
* Open source: After we reach 1000 active users, we claim to open source our bot so that community could troubleshoot and improve the bot

# Block with freelancer's list
> Carousel that rotates between different categories that lists ~5-10 top freelancers in that category. Also has a link to the page that allows users to see all freelancers by category. Yes, we need to create this page as well as stats server HTTP methods.

# Block with closed jobs
> Maybe we can ask some employers from arbeit bot to share their experience and their job offers? I mean the ones that actually did find freelancers here. We can ask clients automatically after the seal the deal.

# Roadmap
> Here we should express what we have already achieved and what we are going to do, maybe we should add a block that fetches issues from GitHub. I imagine this block similar to Facebook timeline, vertical from top to the bottom.
